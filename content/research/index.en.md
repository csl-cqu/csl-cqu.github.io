Our team is mainly committed to cutting-edge research in information security, including: cryptography applications, privacy protection, blockchain, artificial intelligence security, big data security, cloud computing security, multimedia security, computer vision and so on. Our goal is to solve potential problems in the field of artificial intelligence and traditional computer security in the context of the rapid development of computer technology in the new environment of the 21st century. 

Our team hope to ensure privacy information at the same time, actively explore the new direction of the development of the era of big data, trying to solve security faced by machine learning under the wave of new problems, and hope to be able to put forward new theory, to promote the development of in the computer field is then mature technology applied to information security in all areas of life, in turn, to promote the development of society and progress.

We have published many outstanding achievements in high-level academic conferences and journals at home and abroad. At the same time, our team also has exchanges and cooperation with Chinese Academy of Sciences, Huawei, ZTE, Datang Telecom and other units. The research group has sufficient funds, and the research team regularly organizes academic and outdoor activities. It not only provides the international leading scientific research environment, but also creates a good living atmosphere for students. Our research group has close cooperation with overseas first-class universities such as [Hong Kong Baptist University](https://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/v1/), [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/search-results?q=Computer%20Science&searchCat=all&contents=all&page=1), [CIFAR Research Institute](https://cifar.ca/), [Kyushu University](https://www.kyushu-u.ac.jp/en/), [George Mason University](https://www2.gmu.edu/), [Virginia Tech University](https://vt.edu/), and [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/).

Here are some themes and techniques that we currently work on:

## Privacy Protection

Data privacy has been called “the most important issue in the next decade,” and has taken center stage thanks to legislation like the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Researchers are scrambling to keep up with the requirements. In particular, “Privacy by Design” is integral to the GDPR and will likely only gain in popularity this decade. When using privacy preserving techniques, legislation suddenly becomes less daunting, as does ensuring data security which is central to maintaining user trust.

Data privacy is a central issue to training and testing AI models, especially ones that train and infer on sensitive data.We are also actively exploring the direction of perfect privacy AI.

## Artificial Intelligence Security

Industrial intelligence can be divided into three stages: weak artificial intelligence, strong artificial intelligence and super artificial intelligence. Weak artificial intelligence is good at simulating and extending human intelligence in specific fields and within limited rules. Strong AI has consciousness, self-awareness and innovative thinking, and can think, plan, solve problems, think abstractedly, understand complex concepts, quickly learn and learn from experience, and other human-level intelligence work; Superartificial intelligence (AI) is a machine intelligence that vastly exceeds human intelligence in all fields. 

The security connotation of ARTIFICIAL intelligence includes: (1) reduce the security risks brought by the immaturity and malicious application of artificial intelligence to cyberspace and national society; (2) Promote the deep application of ARTIFICIAL intelligence in the field of network security and public security; (3) Build an ARTIFICIAL intelligence safety management system to ensure the safe and steady development of artificial intelligence.

## Big Data Security

The value of big data analysis and mining lies in the prediction and analysis of unknown practices by using the large number theorem mentioned in probability theory. With the rapid development of science and technology, the rapid nonlinear growth of data has brought strategic opportunities for the development of big data. Among them, 2015 is the peak of big data development, and the state has announced the behavioral strategy of big data development. Because big data represents the direction of advanced productivity, it has become an unstoppable trend. However, the current situation of big data security is not very good, there are a lot of hackers through various means to obtain government, enterprise and personal privacy data, in recent years, there are many big or small privacy leakage problems.

With the development of mobile Internet and cloud services, the network boundary has disappeared, and traditional defensive and detection-oriented security protection measures have become inadequate, and big data security has faced challenges. At present, the main difficulty is that it is difficult to apply for access from users in an effective way and it is difficult to detect and control the behavior of developers.

## Multimedia Security

Multimedia information security involves the security guarantee of multimedia generation, transmission, distribution and application. Our research strives to cover the mainstream research content of multimedia related information security, including multimedia data characteristics, cryptography and cryptography analysis techniques, digital watermarking, digital media forensics, biometric authentication and biotemplate security.

## Cloud Computing Security

Cloud computing technology mainly faces the following five security issues: ① user identity management/access control ② network security ③ data security ④ Management security ⑤ virtualization security. 

User identity management is to use appropriate technologies to manage user identities. In this way, users must be authenticated each time they request to access resources, which enhances security. 

AccessControl refers to the means by which the system limits the ability of users to use data resources by restricting their identities and the predefined policy groups to which they belong. 

Network security refers to the ability to identify and eliminate unsafe factors in the network environment. Data security is mainly to encrypt data with limited means to achieve the purpose of data protection. 

The core of management security lies in the establishment of security management standards for cloud services, which define the boundary conditions of security management and the linkage mode between operators and users. So as to realize cloud service availability management, vulnerability management, patch management, configuration management and time emergency response, etc. 

Virtualization technology is the key core technology to realize cloud computing. Cloud architecture providers on the cloud computing platform using virtualization technology can provide security and isolation guarantees to their customers. Virtualization technology is the key technology to fully integrate and efficiently utilize various computing and storage resources. Virtualization is the creation of virtualized (versus real) versions of certain objects, such as operating systems, computer systems, storage devices, and network resources.
